# Maze-Generator-Prototype

This simple project was created as a prototype to resemble the ideas of how to construct a maze.

### About this project:

This is a beginner software project that was created in the past year (~2021) to grasp a greater understanding on the fundamentals towards algorithms. From this project I explored two separate algorithms that were used to construct various types of mazes, providing me an insight towards the time it would take to build the maze as well as the end result bias the maze had.

There are two types of mazes currently available, with images linked to this project. The first maze presents an obvious algorithmic bias but is faster to construct programmatically due to the lack of sophistication, whereas the second maze algorithm has less of a bias but requires more computational power to construct. The quit button at the bottom exits the application.

Each time a maze button is pressed, the maze generates a new prototype of itself based on functions built in the  program. The green and red dots within the maze are in case a user wishes to complete a sample of the maze themselves.
